This stand alone edition of Wrye Mash is based on the latest Yacoby's source. The "editing the file header" bug is fixed
and retains all the extra functionality like drag and drop which is missing from other versions.
It has mlox, TES3cmd and TES3lint support and many new features like:

A toolbar menu,
mod order snapshots,
BSA Archives support,
extended UNICODE support,
Mod Enumeration,
Custom Commands,
Speed optimizations,
MWSE support,
animation package support,
and much more

For the OpenMW implementation of Wrye Mash Polemos fork visit the homepage in Nexus to download the binaries in the url below:

To configure Wrye Mash to run with OpenMW capabilities rename "openmw.dat.ren" => "openmw.dat". This is until the profile system will be completed.

Note: You will find a lot of "Polemos" inside the code. Those are most of my changes.
Another thing also, I use an unorthodox python style, this is by choice (kinda OCD).

v101 updates.
